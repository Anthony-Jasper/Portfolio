          Experience
          Cloudyne Limited
          Director &amp; Front-end Developer

          Music Streaming App
          Developer

          Royal Mail
          Industrial Worker – Mail Sorter
          As the director of Cloudyne I’m responsible for handling the finances, work contracts, T&amp;C for websites and customer support. As for the front-end developer side, I’m responsible for working with the clients during the requirements and design phase, managing fonts, images, CSS, HTML, JQuery and CMS plugins etc. When the site is finished I will also manage their hosting and any support changes they wish to make.
            
          Cloudyne was approached by someone who was interested in developing a music streaming app. Both parties would form under a separate company and have equal shares. The approaching party was responsible for securing funding and company management, whilst my party were responsible for designing and developing the app whilst maintaining it after publication. However, after 1 year, the approaching party was unable to secure the rest of the funding needed to complete the project so it eventually collapsed.
            
          The plan for the project was to create a web-based service and then build native applications that all communicated together. The website wasn’t just for the streaming service itself but was going to be used for pre-development marketing as well.

          In December 2014, I started working for Royal Mail as a Christmas temporary. This involved working within a team to sort through any letters that the machines couldn’t process. I was occasionally assigned to cover for other people within the workplace as well as being responsible for making sure work continued to flow when the line manager was unavailable.

          Project - Match'em Up
          A friend and I wanted to put our skills to the test to see what we were capable of doing. We both decided to create a game in the Unity Engine due to our combined skills within the Engine and JavaScript language. The game became a children's memory game that requires the player to flip over cards and match the images shown. The game was released onto Google Play Store 6 months after development started.
