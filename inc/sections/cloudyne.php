	<h2 class="h2 hfont">Cloudyne Limited</h2>
	<p>Cloudyne is a business that focuses on providing small businesses with up-to-date websites with the latest trends. Websites can be expensive and can come as a shock to some people, so we provide them with reasonable prices for the size of their business. Alongside websites, Cloudyne offers domain and hosting with no increased recurring pricing. I set this business up to continue my personal development and a way for people to promote their business without having to pay a fortune for a bare minimum, basic looking websites.</p>
