# Description
Welcome to my portfolio. The main purpose of this site is to showcase my progression as a front-end developer and display projects that have been completed or are currently in-progress, whilst providing some background information about myself. 

The second purpose is to have this website has a "playground" for me to implement new technologies / features if applicable to the site. This will stop the site from becoming too static and keep it growing and changing over time.

# Website
This is the second rendition of the website. My ambitions were too big for the first one, resulting in the website being clunky and not performing how I expected it to. 

The site has been created in WordPress, using underscores starter theme as the base to build upon. I will be looking to completely move away from WordPress in the future and move it into React. Below are some of the other bits and pieces that are currently on the site.
* npm
* SCSS
* [Foundation Framework](https://get.foundation/)
* JQuery / Vanilla JS
* [Particle.JS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)

### Roadmap
- [ ] Responsive
  * 480-960
  * 961-1280
  * 1280-1600
  * 1600+
- [ ] Re-design Developer Section 
- [ ] Re-design Designer Section 
- [ ] Use Clamp and Grid
- [ ] Adjust Padding / Margins
- [ ] New Font
- [ ] Better Images
- [ ] Convert into React

# Game Development
This game was created to help with learning vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas. The game is a 2D Shooter set in space. You control a ship using A + D to travel along the horizontal axis whilst using the space bar to shoot "aliens" that are travelling along the Y axis.

To start building the game I used a [tutorial on W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp) to follow along and get a basis for the code. Once that was completed, I started to modify the code to fit the style of game I wanted.

### Current Features
* Menu
* Shop
  * Locked Ships
  * Currency
* 3 Different Ships
* Score
* Enemy Faction - Small Ships + Boss
* Loot Drops (# of Projectiles)
* Boss Health
### Roadmap
- [ ] HUD
- [ ] Weapons Stats (Dmg - Speed)(Need to do Better Weapon Design First)
- [ ] UI - Confirmations / Currently Active
- [ ] Turn Score Threshold into Timer
- [ ] Spawning Speeds for Enemies
- [ ] Movement Increase per Level for Enemies
- [ ] Enemies that shoot projectiles
### Known Issues
* Framerate Drops When Splicing Enemies and Projectiles
* Menu Items - Looping(Includes Ship Purchasing)
